# Corpus

This branch contains the CFR Corpus, which serves the CFR from from 1997, using a combination of year, title, and part as the index. The source for this data is the GPO Bulk html from https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/CFR. Some titles are included for 1996.

This corpus requires the CFR Databank, available from https://s3.amazonaws.com/quantgov-databanks/cfr/cfr.zip.
