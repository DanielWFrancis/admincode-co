# Corpus

*Official QuantGov Corpora*

This repository is for those who would like to create new datasets using the QuantGov platform. If you would like to find data that has been produced using the QuantGov platform, please visit http://www.quantgov.org/data.

This repository contains all official QuantGov corpora, with each corpus stored in its own branch. The `master` branch of this repository is the Generic Corpus, which serves all files in the data/clean folder, with the file path as the index. Scripts for wordcount and regulatory restriction count are included, however, only the wordcount is included in the data/metadata.csv by default. See the `makefile` for more details.

For more information about QuantGov see http://www.quantgov.org. Technical documentation for the QuantGov platform is provided at http://docs.quantgov.org.
